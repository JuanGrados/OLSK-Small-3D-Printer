Introduction
--

OLSK Small 3D Printer V1 is an open source desktop 3D printer with printing volume of 200 x 200 x 200 mm. Its rigid frame, fully composed of aluminum intelocked plates, and its robust linear rail system makes the machine very stable for printing, in addition to the ballscrew Z-axis ball screw which contributes to its precision. The adjustable and auto-leveling bed is heated and with good adhesion, covered with an non-sticking layer to facilitate the removal of the prints. The housing is enclosed to keep a higher temperature. It also features a touch screen, light and sound indicators and silent motion using trinamic drivers.

The Assembly Workbook
--

All OLSK machines are open source and have the BOM and necessary files available in this repository for replication. The assembly of parts is also documented in a workbook where each step contains a list of parts, tools and instruction remarks, following a logic order to provide a smooth assembly.
